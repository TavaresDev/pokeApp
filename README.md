# Documenting My Process

## 1 Understanding the project

- Read the instructions
- Read about the API
- Check some examples

## 2 Sckething a wireframe

- Some drawings for the layout
- Plan possible states to manage
- Find a colour pallet from the pokemon franchise

## 3 Deciding on the stack

- Decide to use the JavaScript starter, because this project although cool, is
  not going to be maintained
- Chose a Ui Lib called Mantine, a lightweight and simple UI, named after a
  pokemon =)
- Added the Styled-components lib for custom CSS
- Added useContext for global state

## 4 Developing

- Made a form, get data from the user and validate using formHook
- Make search pokemon feature with fetch API, didn't see the need to use Axios
- Refactor to use Steppers to create a better user experience
- Refactor the Fetch for reusability and caching data making a custom hook
- Fixing bugs and improving the layout
